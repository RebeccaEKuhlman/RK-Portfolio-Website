In leu of a… "coders block"… I've been timing myself work, and "paying" myself for the time I sit down and work. I think I can make this idea into a react app, "Project Payer". It will work as a stopwatch, and calculate what I've earned automatically. It could also separate projects out, which would be useful if it was used for hourly contractors, and if different projects paid different amounts. A full version would require a database and accounts, so for now I'll develop the frontend and when I take Databases next semester, I'll fully flesh it out.

This summer, I have decided to dedicate a lot of my time to doing side projects. The first project I'll spent a good amount of time on is a personal website. It's a great starting place, a good organization point, etc. I'll use the things a learned during GUI, then updated it as my programming skills improve and I learn new things. I have a lot of engineering projects that I'd like to show off, more than just what my github could show off. I'll have to look into making a list of applications I'd like to make as well. I'm not too much of a fan of remaking tic-tac-toe for the sake of practice - I want to create something new and improved.
