                              The idea was a fish bowl, the glass replaced with acrylic, and the sand replaced with saw dust. I filled the car with sea creatures and 3D printed benchy boats, and painted it.
                              While I definitely sacrificed function over form, my car crossed the finish line in reasonable time, and I was quite proud of how it turned out.
