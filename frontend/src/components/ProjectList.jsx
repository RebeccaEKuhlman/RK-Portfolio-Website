                          I worked on a lot of the parts requiring the vinyl cutter, gaining a new appreciation of its potential as tool. Playing with the utilization of space, and drawing the audience to look at a certain places in the maze was very fun and informative! The picture is a doll I crocheted, which turned out much creepier than I expected.

                          <p className="card-text">The DIG's Annual derby. I helped organized the event as a team member, and made a car myself.
                              The idea was a fish bowl, the glass replaced with acrylic, and the sand replaced with saw dust. I filled the car with sea creatures and 3D printed benchy boats, and painted it.
                              While I definitely sacrificed function over form, my car crossed the finish line in reasonable time, and I was quite proud of how it turned out.
                              I won the DIG Derpy's Most Wild Car award for my efforts.

                                  I first made the base car, laser cutting the wheels, and getting a good block of wood for the body. 
                                      I experimented with some wood carving with a Dremel, and while an interesting exercise, it didn't go into the final car.
                                      Once I decided on the theme of my car, I went to work on laser cutting the acrylic for the bowl. 
                                      I knew I wasn't going to get a true round fishbowl, and instead focused on making sure that it would be easily attachable to the body. 
                                      After securing the acrylic, I went into the details. I collected sawdust from my woodshop projects, got some leftover benchies*, and some paint.
                                      A lot of glue later, the car was completed.

                                      *The Benchy boat is a common 3D print for testing that a 3D printer works. It's often done after a machine is fixed to confirm it's operating properly. 
                                      Given that the DIG has quite a few 3D printers, we have a lot of benchies lying around.
